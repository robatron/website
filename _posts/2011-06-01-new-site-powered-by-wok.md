Here it is, [my new website][mysite]. It was created using [wok][], an awesome
static website generator written by my friend and ex-coworker,
[Mike Cooper][cooper].

[wok]:https://github.com/mythmon/wok

Wok allowed me to create a consistent and maintainable website without the need
for any kind of server-side engine like Django or PHP. It's just a clean set
of HTML, so nothing special is needed to serve or view it. Pretty nifty :)

Please feel free to peruse the code on its [GitHub project page][github] and
leave any comments that you'd like.

Enjoy the site and thanks for reading!
